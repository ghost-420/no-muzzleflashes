=== no_MuzzleFlashes-sentry_MF_visible.vpk
Nulls the property of all particles still visible (that the included weapon scripts didn't take care of); expect the muzzleflashes for Sentry Guns are left turned on.

=== no_MuzzleFlashes.vpk
Same process as the VPK above, with Sentry Gun particles also nulled.
